\chapter*{\centering {\normalsize Abstract}}
\noindent In this document I have tried to reorder the notes of the Subnuclear Physics course held by Professor Donatella Lucchesi at the Department of Physics of the University of Padua during the second semester of the 2019-20 academic year of the master's degree in Physics of Fundamental Interactions.

The notes are fully integrated with the material provided by the professor in the Moodle platform. In addition, I will integrate them, as best as possible, with the books recommended by the professor.

There may be formatting errors, wrong marks, missing exponents and even missing parts, since I'm still working on them. If you find errors or if you have any suggestions, let me know (ypu can send an e-mail at rocco.ardino@studenti.unipd.it, labeled with \textbf{SP::TYPO/SUGGESTION}) and I will correct/integrate them, so that this document can be a good study support. However, these notes are not to be intended as a substitute of the lectures held by the professor or of lecture notes made by other people.
